# VNAV Algorithm

## Removed due to proprietary software
## kept some functioning (pseudo-ish) code for documentation

PART 1 of VNAV: Calculate Information of a Step

### STEP
Calculate ROC, Altitude, Weight, Distance of a step to be used in VNAV\'

#### TO-DO
- Finish get_climbrate()
- Finish in general lol

#### concerns
- "Final distance to Altitude (altitude)" <-- from Code Layout
- Constants for fuel loss calculations?
