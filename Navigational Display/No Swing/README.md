# Navigational Display
## Demo code
Creating the 787's Navigational Display for X-Plane.\
Based on and to resemble the one shown in 787 Flight Crew Operations Manual.\

`Window.java` is the main runner

Created two types:
1) One with swing components (e.g. JButton). Swing components may cause difficulties in implementing it into X-Plane
2) All objects are hard-coded into `paintComponent()` method. Easier to implement into X-Plane
