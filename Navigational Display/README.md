#### Demo visual of Navigational Display
It is a realistic version of the navigational display seen in Boeing 787-9. It shows the flight path (purple line) of the plane (simple isosceles triangle at bottom center) along with some information of the plane (details and numbers around the display) such as the destination, its current direction and distance travelled.\

#### Demo visual of just the Route Visualizer (path of plane from Destination A to B)
The core of the navigational display. It shows the route of the plane from start (e.g. an airport) to a destination. Along the way, there is waypoints that the plane must follow (in this picture it is GB270, GB277, and KUXOX) that guide the plane to its final destination. Real life examples include all planes going out of their way and fly away from Tibet because it is dangerous or a plane doing a U-turn.\
